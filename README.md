A linked list is a linear data structure which can store a collection of "nodes" connected together via links i.e. pointers. Linked lists nodes are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers to the different memory locations. A node consists of the data value and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list.

Stacks is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top. Implementation of the stack can be done by contiguous memory which is an array, and non-contiguous memory which is a linked list.
- Inserting a new element in the stack is termed a push operation.
- Removing or deleting elements from the stack is termed pop operation.
