A linked list is a linear data structure which can store a collection of "nodes" connected together via links i.e. pointers. Linked lists nodes are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers to the different memory locations. A node consists of the data value and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list.

Stacks is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top. Implementation of the stack can be done by contiguous memory which is an array, and non-contiguous memory which is a linked list.
- Inserting a new element in the stack is termed a push operation.
- Removing or deleting elements from the stack is termed pop operation.

Queue is a linear collection of different data types which follow a specific order while performing various operations. It can only be modified by the addition of data entities at one end or the removal of data entities at another. By convention, the end where insertion is performed is called Rear, and the end at which deletion takes place is known as the Front.
- Enqueue() - Insertion of elements to the queue.
- Dequeue() - Removal of elements from the queue.
- Peek() - Acquires the data element available at the front node of the queue without deleting it.
- isFull() - Validates if the queue is full.
- isNull() - Checks if the queue is empty.
